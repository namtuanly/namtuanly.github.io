## About me
I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at [Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology](https://www.tuat.ac.jp/en/) (Japan), broadly working in the area of Document and Pattern Recognition. I was a postdoc at [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) (Japan) and a visiting scholar at [Centre for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence](https://www.concordia.ca/research/cenparmi.html), Concordia University (Canada). I obtained my P.h.D from the Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, in Sep. 2021, under supervision of Prof. Masaki Nakagawa.

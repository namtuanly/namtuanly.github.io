## About me
I'm an assistant professor of Computer Science at [Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology](https://www.tuat.ac.jp/en/) (Japan). Previously, I was a postdoc at [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) (Japan) and a visiting scholar at [Centre for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence](https://www.concordia.ca/research/cenparmi.html), Concordia University (Canada). I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, in Sep. 2021, under the supervision of Prof. Masaki Nakagawa. My research mainly focuses on the topic of Document and Pattern Recognition, including: Document Layout Analysis, Table Recognition, Mathematical Expression Recognition and Text Recognition.

## Research Interests

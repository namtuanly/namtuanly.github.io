@article{Ly2020,
abstract = {This paper presents an attention-based row-column encoder-decoder (ARCED) model for recognizing an input image of multiple text lines from Japanese historical documents without explicit segmentation of lines. The recognition system has three main parts: a feature extractor, a row-column encoder, and a decoder. We introduce a row-column BLSTM in the encoder and a residual LSTM network in the decoder. The whole system is trained end-to-end by a standard cross-entropy loss function, requiring only document images and their ground-truth text. We experimentally evaluate the performance of ARCED on the dataset of Japanese historical documents: Kana-PRMU. The results of the experiments show that ARCED outperforms the state-of-the-art recognition methods on the dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the row-column BLSTM in the encoder and the residual LSTM in the decoder improves the performance of the encoder-decoder model for the recognition of Japanese historical document.}

@article{Ly2019,
abstract = {This paper presents recognition of anomalously deformed Kana sequences in Japanese historical documents, for which a contest was held by IEICE PRMU 2017. The contest was divided into three levels in accordance with the number of characters to be recognized: level 1: single characters, level 2: sequences of three vertically written Kana characters, and level 3: unrestricted sets of characters composed of three or more characters possibly in multiple lines. This paper focuses on the methods for levels 2 and 3 that won the contest. We basically follow the segmentation-free approach and employ the hierarchy of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) for frame prediction, and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for text recognition, which is named a Deep Convolutional Recurrent Network (DCRN). We compare the pretrained CNN approach and the end-to-end approach with more detailed variations for level 2. Then, we propose a method of vertical text line segmentation and multiple line concatenation before applying DCRN for level 3. We also examine a two-dimensional BLSTM (2DBLSTM) based method for level 3. We present the evaluation of the best methods by cross validation. We achieved an accuracy of 89.10% for the three-Kana-character sequence recognition and an accuracy of 87.70% for the unrestricted Kana recognition without employing linguistic context. These results prove the performances of the proposed models on the level 2 and 3 tasks.}
